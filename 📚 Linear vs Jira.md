### 🧑‍💻 For a Solo Developer, Here's the Practical Take

#### ✅ **Choose Linear if you want:**

- A _minimal, elegant_ task-tracking system that stays out of your way.

- Fast keyboard-based workflow (think: “like Superhuman for issue tracking”).

- An _opinionated_ but frictionless experience — e.g., issues auto-close when PRs are merged.

- Lightweight project planning: cycles (sprints), roadmaps, and issues — all easy to manage.

- Aesthetically pleasant and low maintenance UI.

#### ✅ **Choose Jira if you need:**

- _Power-user control_ — advanced workflows, permissions, states, custom fields.

- Deep integration with Atlassian tools (Bitbucket, Confluence).

- More enterprise-oriented automation (e.g., post-function scripting, conditional logic).

- Flexibility to create complex workflows or experiment with agile templates.

### 🛠️ Example Use Case: You’re building an app solo

- **With Linear:** You’d spin up a project, add milestones, create issues, and track progress all from the keyboard. You’ll stay in flow.

- **With Jira:** You’d spend time customizing the board, setting up statuses, and integrating with CI/CD. You’d get enterprise power, but you’ll manage more overhead.

### 🧠 Recommendation for a Solo Dev

> 🟢 **Use Linear** unless you **specifically need** Jira’s enterprise-grade features.  
> Linear is optimized for solo devs or small teams moving fast. Jira is a better fit when you’re scaling or collaborating with more stakeholders.
