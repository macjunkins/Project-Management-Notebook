## 🌿 2. **GitKraken Branch Naming Cheat Sheet**

> For consistency between Linear and GitHub. Use in GitKraken when creating new branches from issues.

```markdown
feature/linear-[issue-id]-[short-description]
bugfix/linear-[issue-id]-[short-description]
hotfix/linear-[issue-id]-[short-description]
chore/linear-[issue-id]-[short-description]
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
feature/linear-med-105-refill-alert
bugfix/linear-ui-031-pillbox-header-overlap
hotfix/linear-core-099-login-crash
chore/linear-admin-010-cleanup-env
```

### Optional Tip

You can add an alias to GitKraken’s built-in templates or Git CLI aliases if you want to streamline branch naming later.

## 📁 3. **Linear Projects & Sprints Doc Structure**

> How to organize your Linear workspace to fit your solo dev/founder mindset.

### 🔸 Projects

Create one **Linear Project per MVP** (or per major feature set):

```markdown
🟦 MVP – MedTracker
🟩 MVP – Calendar Assistant
🟧 MVP – Refill Reminder Logic
```

Or by work theme:

```markdown
📦 MVPs
📣 Marketing
🧾 Admin & Ops
```

### 🔸 Labels

Use for filtering and visual clarity:

- `#dev`

- `#marketing`

- `#admin`

- `#low`, `#med`, `#high` (priority)

- `#sprint-25`, `#sprint-26` (optional)

### 🔸 Cycles (2-week Sprints)

- Use Linear **Cycles** to represent your 2-week sprints

- Title as `Sprint 25 – MVP Foundation`, `Sprint 26 – Refill UX`

- Track all `#dev` issues here

- Use `View: Cycle` to see dev-only weekly work

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips (Optional)

- Keep a **“This Sprint” view** in Linear that shows:

  - `Status: In Progress or Planned`

  - `Cycle: current`

  - `Label: #dev`

- For longer-form specs or ideas: write in **Obsidian**, then attach summary or link to Linear issue

- Don’t bother syncing Linear ↔ GitHub unless:

  - You're tired of manual linking

  - You're doing deep automation later
