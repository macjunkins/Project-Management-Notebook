# Sprint Planning for Linear

## 🏁 **Sprint Planning Template for Linear (Solo Developer Edition)**

### 🌱 Before You Begin

- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (sync with Apple Calendar)

- **Naming Convention**: `Sprint YYWW – [Theme]` (e.g., `Sprint 25–MVP Foundations`)

- **Workflow Statuses**:

  - `Backlog` → `Planned` → `In Progress` → `Review` → `Done`

  - Optional: `Blocked`, `Won’t Do`

---

### ✅ 1. Sprint Details

Create a new **project** or **milestone** (depending on how you prefer to organize sprints).

**Sprint Title:**  
`Sprint 25 – [Theme or Goal]`

**Sprint Duration:**  
`July 15–July 28`

**Sprint Goals:**  
_(What do you want to accomplish by the end?)_

- Finalize medication box checklist feature

- Set up GitHub repo structure and CI

- Publish 1 blog post about MVP planning

- Prep social post announcing progress

**Key Dates:**

- Kickoff: July 15

- Mid-Sprint Review: July 22 (15 mins check-in)

- Sprint End + Review: July 28

---

### ✅ 2. Sprint Sections (Use Labels or Views)

Break work into categories using **labels** or **custom views**.

**Categories:**

- `#dev` — Code tasks, bugs, CI, etc.

- `#product` — MVP planning, app flows, feature specs

- `#marketing` — Blog, content, social media

- `#admin` — Business, accounts, documentation

---

### ✅ 3. Sprint Tasks (Linear Issues)

Each task/issue should have:

- 🎯 **Title**: Clear, outcome-focused

- 📝 **Description**: What’s needed, any context from Obsidian

- 🧠 **Labels**: `#category`, `#priority`, `#solo-role`

- 🗓️ **Due Date**: Align with sprint duration

- 📎 **Linked Docs**: Link to GitHub PR, Obsidian note, Figma, etc.

Example Task:

```markdown
Title: Implement refill reminder logic in medication tracker

Labels: #dev, #MVP1, #priority-high  
Project: Sprint 25 – MVP Foundations  
Due: July 20  
Description:  
- Use current manual system as base logic  
- Trigger logic based on remaining pill count  
- Draft message copy in Obsidian  
- Push feature branch to GitHub and test
```

---

### ✅ 4. Mid-Sprint Review (Optional but Useful)

Check progress halfway through. Ask:

- What’s done?

- What’s blocked?

- Anything I overestimated or missed?

- Can I defer or remove low-priority tasks?

---

### ✅ 5. End of Sprint Review (Retrospective)

Add a comment to the sprint project, or keep a personal Obsidian entry with:

- ✅ What I finished

- 🚧 What I didn’t

- 🔄 What to improve (too much scope? distractions?)

- 📌 Notes for next sprint

---

## 🧩 Pro Tips for Linear Setup

- Use **Cycles** for sprints, **Projects** for long-term goals/MVPs.

- Pin a **“This Sprint” view** to your sidebar: filtered by current cycle.

- Use **Sub-issues** for tasks that need 2–3 steps (i.e., Dev + Marketing + Deploy).

- Optional: Create a saved view for each hat you wear (e.g., “Marketing Work”, “Dev Only”).
